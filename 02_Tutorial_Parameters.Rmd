#  Step 2: Set your parameters {#parameters}

The next step allows you to set your desired parameters for creating your SPC charts. The tab should look like the following:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Application page to set your parameters"}
knitr::include_graphics("step2_set_parameters.png")
```

The left-side panel contains all the options you will need. The first is the desired multiplier. In a hospital context, this is often "per how many patient days". The default option is 1000, so make sure to select 1 if you do not wish to have a multiplier. 

The next three drop down menus are populated with the column names of your data. You must match the desired column with its desired purpose. For SPC charts you have a a date column or subgroups (values to plot along the x-axis), and a value column (measures or counts to plot along the y-axis). In some cases you may have a column of subgroup sizes. If this is not applicable to your use-case, then simple leave the "Denominator (subgroup sizes)" as "SELECT" and it will not be used. 

The final option on the left-side panel is a check box that says "Check this box if you want to compare your data based on a qualitative grouping column, ex. departments". If this is applicable to your data, you may check this box. This will create another drop-down box populated with your data's column's names. Select the column that you wish to compare across like you did in the previous drop-down menus. 

We have set the following parameters for our example CLABSI data:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Parameters are set for example CLABSI data"}
knitr::include_graphics("step2_successfully_set_parameters.png")
```

We want to use 1000 for our multiplier so that the data is represented in per 1000 patient days. For the date (x-axis) we will use the column named "date". For the numerator (y-axis) we will use the counts of CLABSI events in the column named "clabsi_count". For CLABSI events, we do have subgroup size data. So, for the denominator drop-down we select the column named "central_line_days". 

Finally, we have decided that we want to compare the CLABSI rates across departments. We have a single column named "department" which contains the department where the CLABSI events occurred.

After you are satisfied with your parameters, you may click the "Continue" button to proceed with the analysis.

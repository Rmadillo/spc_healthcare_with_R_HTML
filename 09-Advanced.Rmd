# Is there a difference? {#advanced}

Too many leaders and clinicians got only one or two stats classes in their background, and as a result are tediously tied to the ritual of Statistical Hypothesis Inference Testing (more commonly known as frequentism, but this has a better acronym).  

This slavish devotion has harmed and even killed people.  


## *Is there a difference?* is not SPC

SPC methods do *not* tell you whether there is a statisically-signifianct difference between two segments of a time series. Even if it did, it's a trivial answer to the wrong question.

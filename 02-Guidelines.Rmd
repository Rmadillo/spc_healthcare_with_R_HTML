| **Identifying possible signals of change in run charts** | **Detecting special cause variation in control charts** |
|  |  | 
| *"Astronomical" data point:* a point so different from the rest that anyone would agree that the value is unusual. | *One or more points fall outside the control limit:* if the data are distributed according to the given control chart's assumptions, the probability of seeing a point outside the control limits when the process has not changed is very low. |
|  |  | 
| *Process shift:* $log_2(n) + 3$ data points are all above or all below the median line, where $n$ is the total number of points that do $not$ fall directly on the median line. | *Process shift:* $log_2(n) + 3$ data points are all above or all below the mean line, where $n$ is the total number of points that do $not$ fall directly on the mean(?) line. |
|  |  | 
| *Number of crossings:* Too many or too few median line crossings suggest a pattern inconsistent with natural variation [see Chapter 6.1](#runcharts). | *Number of crossings:* Too many or too few center line crossings suggest a pattern inconsistent with natural variation ([see Chapter 6.1](#runcharts)). | 
|  |  | 
| *Trend:* Seven or more consecutive points all increasing or all decreasing (though this can be an ineffective indicator\*). | *Trend:* Seven or more consecutive points all increasing or all decreasing (though this can be an ineffective indicator\*).  | 
|  |  | 
| *Cycles:* There are obvious cycles that are not linked to known causes such as seasonality. | *Cycles:* There are obvious cycles of any sort. | 
|  |  | 
| | *Reduced variation:* Fifteen or more consecutive points all within 1$\sigma$. | 
|  |  | 
| | *1$\sigma$ signal:* Four of five consecutive points are more than one standard deviation away from the mean. | 
|  |  | 
| | *2$\sigma$ signal:* Two of three consecutive points are more than two standard deviations away from the mean. |

\**Note: Although many people use a "trend" test in association with run and control charts, research has shown this test to be ineffective (see [Useful References](#useful)).*
